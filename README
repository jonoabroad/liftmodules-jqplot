JqPlot Module 


TODO : 

 * replace x & y width w & h 
 * get pie chart working correctly
 * use Json or scala datatypes rather than String for series & option - possibly have string as a easy way to hack. But beware of implicit conversion.
 * Only put sutff in head once, use a RequestVar to say if something has been included,
   if it has don't include again. Then look at something clever that does it at the end of the request life cycle.
